	<h4>Is Volleyball for you?</h4>
	<p>Volleyball is a sport that is safe, fun and does not require extreme fitness.</p>
	<p>Court movement is minimal so it’s a great low-impact sport that will help you get fit without pushing your limit. Games are exciting and intense, but there’s always a net between you and your opponents.</p>
	<p>Beach volleyball is suitable for all ages and genders.
	Anyone considering starting a new sport or exercise program should see their doctor first.</p>
	<h4>How to play</h4>
	<p>Volleyball is a sport played by two teams divided by a net.</p>
	<p>The object of the game is to send the ball over the net to the ground it on the opponent's court, and to prevent it from getting grounded on your side.</p>
	<p>The ball is put into play by the server who position is in the right back-row, who serves is over the net.</p>
	<p>A team is allowed to touch the ball three times (blocking included) to return it to the opponent's court.</p>
	<p>A player is not allowed to hit the ball consecutively, except when attempting a block.
	<p>The team winning a rally scores a point (Rally Point System). When the receiving team wins a rally, it gains a point and the right to serve, and its players rotate one position clockwise.</p>
	<p>The best of 3 or best of 5 games will win matches. Each non-deciding game will be won by first team to score 25 points with a minimum  2 point advantage (no scoring cap).</p>
	<p>If there is a deciding game, it will be won by the first team to score 15 points with a minimum 2 point advantage (no scoring cap).</p>
